title: Accident Information Form
---

This form is used to enter and maintain information about accidents and incidents involving your fleet's vehicles. Using the form, you capture the particulars about an accident such as the driver's name, location of accident, vehicle involved, etc.

You may notice the tabs at the top of the form. The Accident Information Form uses tabs to separate distinctive parts of the form. To navigate between the tabs you merely click on the tab with your cursor. Think of these electronic tabs just like the tabs in a notebook and you should have no problem navigating on the form. Let's briefly look at each tab:

## [Accident Information](./accident-information-tab/)

This is the first tab you see on the Accident Information Form. It contains the vast majority of the general information about the accident.

## [Detailed Comments](./detailed-comments-witnesses-tab/)

This is the second tab you see on the form. This field allows you to type up to 50,000 characters into the field about the accident.

## Other Vehicles

This is the third tab you see on the form. This is where you enter in information about the other vehicle or vehicles involved in the accident.

## Accident Passengers

The fourth tab you see on the form is to capture information about the passengers in the accident. You can capture information about student, employee, or other passengers.

## Accident Photos

The fifth tab at the top of the page is used to display all the accident photos that may have been taken. You can link as many photos of the accident as you want.

## Accident Work Orders

The sixth tab allows you to link Work Orders that are related to the repair of your vehicle.

In order to begin filling out the Accident Information Form, you will first have to complete data entry in the following forms: Vehicle Information, so you can link the vehicle involved in the accident (found in the Vehicle Module), Employee Information, so you can link the employee involved in the accident (found in the Employee Module), and the following support tables found in the Support Tables Module - Accident - Category, Accident - Impact, Accident - Maneuver, and Accident - Type. These last tables come pre-installed with data, so you may not need to do anything in these areas.
